This a repo containing scripts, database, and templates for creating a rental property tracking website. This utilizes a python Flask app alongside a SQL database to track expenses, 
incoming payments, recurring fees, and tenant balance. This provides a clean cut overview of property statuses through both views of these factors in full as well as reports that 
can be generated to understand where expenses/income are coming from.
